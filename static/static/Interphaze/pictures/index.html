kurt busiek's astro city #22
***
words: kurt busiek
pictures: brent anderson, will blyberg
cover: alex ross
$2.50 from wildstorm/homage/DC comics

Long-awaited, but just not that great.  
Kind of a bummer since the author is 
going through terrible health problems.  
Still, this issue just seemed a little 
lackluster.  Maybe the AC formula is 
wearing thin for me, but I doubt it. 
There's a quivering fanboy in all of us, 
just waiting to emerge...

Acme Novelty Library vol 6 #8
*****
words &amp; pictures: chris ware
$12.95 from Fantagraphics

No that's not a misprint, $12.95 for a 
comic book!&nbsp; Not just any comic though,
the final chapter in the twisted tale of 
Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on
Earth. All the loose ends tie together, 
but the ending surprised me, straying
from ware's distant cold approach to finally 
show the humanity in his<BR>characters.</pre></td>

stray bullets #21
****
words &amp; pictures: david lapham
$2.95 from El Capitan
Another great genre tale from lapham.&nbsp; 
I'm so happy he chooses to stay true to
his own vision, rather than sell out to 
hollywood, because he writes circles
around most screenwriters.&nbsp; This 
issue depicts what happens when a momentary
fantasy goes too far, done with a nice hard 
realistic edge.</pre></td>

I can't do this comic justice by simply 
describing it. Let's just call it a
highly personal vision of humanity by a 
talented creator.&nbsp; M'kay?&nbsp; 
Read this comic!</pre></td>

the atomics #5
**
words &amp; pictures: mike allred
colors: laura allred
$2.95 from AAA pop comics

Adam Balm is attacked as the team starts 
construction of their ultra-ginchy new
underground HQ.&nbsp; While I love Allred's 
visuals, this title seems even more mired
in tired old genre convention than Madman.
&nbsp; But the artist seems to wallow in
the veneer of kitsch nostalgia, while 
producing works that transcend the 
limitations of mere cultural reference.&nbsp; 
I'll stick around a couple more issues, but 
unless the plot starts going somewhere 
interesting, I'm gone.</pre></td>

words &amp; pictures: Eddie Campbell
$2.95 from Eddie Campbell Comics

Will the one-eyed titular god ever return to the 
pages of his own book? Campbell continues in the 
trend of recent issues by only publishing his recent
autobio work, and leaving the genre-melding 
fiction aside for a bit.&nbsp; I don't
mind that much though, because few creators today can 
touch Mr. Campbell in their ability to evoke reality 
through subtly nuanced art and dialogue.</pre></td>

goody good comics #1
****
anthology featuring: Rick Altergott, Johnny Ryan, 
and Los Bros Hernandez
$2.95 from Fantagraphics Books

This mixed bag is rich with quality creators and 
fun comics.&nbsp; The cover of a robot eating ribs 
by Gilbert Hernandez is worth the price of 
admission alone. Rick Altergott's Doofus returns, 
and is in good company with the works of Johnny
Ryan and his greasy protagonist.&nbsp; Just read it 
and enjoy!</pre></td>

American Splendor - Bedtime Stories one-shot
****
words: Harvey Pekar
pictures:David Collier, Dean Haspiel, Spain Rodriguez, 
Joe Sacco, and Frank Stack
$3.95 from the Dark Horse Maverick imprint

Pekar's ultra-realism combined with the likes of Sacco 
and Spain adds up to a very satisfying read.&nbsp; 
Harvey keeps getting older and still has to work his 
ass off just to make a living.&nbsp; The best pieces 
by far in the book are thebiographies of blues legends,
T-Bone Walker and BB king.&nbsp; Drawn by Sacco and Spain 
respectively, the pieces follow in Crumb's footsteps by 
profiling the true source of inspiration for the vapid 
rock stars that followed in their wake.</pre></td>

Reinventing Comics
*****
words and pictures: Scott McCloud
$19.95 from Paradox Press
	
The follow up to Understanding Comics, this time 
McCloud strays beyond formal dissection of the medium 
to offer hints on where it's future may lie.
Truly a must-read for the comics scholar/geeks out there.</pre></td>
