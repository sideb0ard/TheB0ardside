i dont' think i had my first bowl till i was about four years old.
It was probably Frosties. Even then i wanted a second bowl,
but it wasn't until later years that it got out of hand.

	My mother must surely be partly to blame; Every thursday 
she would come home from ASDA, arms laden with groceries, and 
contained within those bags, i would normally find two to three 
boxes of cereal.

	I was the only child in the house, who else was to eat them?
It didn't matter which.. Rice Krispies, Corn Flakes(Honey-nut or 
plain-vanilla), Sugar Puffs, Weetabix, Shreddies, Frosties...
but never a supermarket imitation. My mother knew well my scornful
sneer at anything less than Kellogs, Quaker, Nabisco, whatever, but
it had to be an original.

	As i grew up, it was never mentioned in the house. My mother
would go on silently re-stocking the cupb0ard supplies, but i could
feel her eyes upon my in the morning as i'd finish my third bowl, or
my Gran's frown as i turned down plates of fish and chips or fish 
fingers in favor of my Grandfather's Shredded Wheat at lunch break.
Even my father was wary of me as i ate my Frosties after having just 
finished dinner.

	Late at night, sometimes i couldn't sleep and would go downstairs
to rustle myself up a little sugar-frosted night-cap. i remember many
an occasion, standing on the cold-ass kitchen linoleum floor, dressed 
only in my underwear, wolfing down one helping so that i could take 
another bowlful back to bed.

	Sure i experimented with other types, Ricicles and Coco Pops
were favourites in my younger years, but i never did take a like for
the novelty brightly colored types, all those cute pink and yellow
tacky kiddie brands. i never liked those popcorn type ones either.
i guess i'm just more into the more adult traditional crop-based brands.

	Another contributing factor was the fact that no-one ever took 
the time to teach me to cook. i was left to fend for myself. It was tough
back then; i was young, reckless, out climbing, running, hiding, getting
chased... but then i would be home and hungry, ravenous even. All i could 
make was cereal, maybe the occasional bit of t0ast.

	Later, i moved out, got my own apartment, took on responsibilities,
started doing my own shopping. I was horrified at the price i had to pay 
for a 750g box. The other boxes just looked so, so small. i needed the 
security of knowing i wouldn't run out.

	Without supervision i took to eating more and more cereal.
Some nights i couldn't go out, becuz i had just eaten too much to move.
I started avoiding going to the pub, becuz i hated the taste of cereal
and milk when you've been drinking beer all night.

	My friends who dropped by started to comment on the amount of
empty cereal boxes by the bin. i never said much, brushed it off with a
laugh, but i was more careful after that.

	It got heavier. It began to affect my work. I'd buy boxes to take
to the office. I'd have a few bowls in the morning while everyone else was
at the cafeteria. How smug i was, thinking about them eating their greasy
rolls and bacon and sausage.

	It went on like this for months, acting more and more furtively, 
avoiding people, not going out. i had no money for anything but cereal, 
not clothes, not rent or bills. I'd visit my mother's house regularly and
raid her cupb0ards for boxes to take back to the flat with me.
She was too scared to say anything.

	Eventually i didn't have money for hash. That was it, i realised 
i had a problem.

	I've now faced up to it, but it doesn't go away. The craving
doesn't any easier. i don't think there is any easy solution, it's just a
matter of control. i broke down in front of my my family and friends and
told them everything. They've been great. Very supportive. They sometimes
bring me a box when they visit. It's good to have this out in the open, 
i no longer carry this dark secret. i just limit myself, maybe three bowls
a day, little more on weekends, and special occasions.

	I do, i kind of feel good about it, and feel good about myself.
Just livin'... one day at a time
one day at a time.
