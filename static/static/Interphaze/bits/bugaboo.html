<pre>



Say my name, say my name 
you acting kinda shady.
'Shady', thats one way to descrive Windoze,
but ya know, we all gotta work with it sometimes.

Here are some of our tips for making Windows just that
little bit less frustrating or easier:

Command Completion:
After being on a *nix box for so long, and using the
tab complete, it starts to get really annoying in Windows
trying to type all those case sensitive longass folder names
with spaces, like 'c:\Documents and Setting\Beyonce\mp3z'.
Phh! whateva! How's about doing this:
Open regedit and go to:
\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor
and either change or make a new entry for a DWORD value
of 'CompletionChar' and make it's value "9".
Reboot for registry changes to effect.

IE Download limits:
Now when i'm downloading some new mp3z, i certainly don't like
IE's limitation of downloading two files at a time.
What the hell was Bill G thinking?
Again, back into regedit,
and this time we are going to go to:
\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
and either add or change the entry for 
'MaxConnectionsPerServer' and 'MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server'.
The first entry is for HTML1.1 and the second for 1.0.
The default is two downloads, go ahead crank that up, baby!
For mo info go see MS Article ID: Q181145
Again, reboot for changes.


So, hope these work for ya, and please, email me if you have any other
tips you'd like to share. -- beyonce@interphaze.org
