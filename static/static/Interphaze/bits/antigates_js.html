Getting info about stuff on a web page<br>
--------------------------------------
<br><br>
Everything you could possibly want to know about a page is contained in the
"object hierarchy"  The object hierarchy is an upside-down tree.  The trunk of
this tree is an object called "window".  Alone, window isn't very interesting.
The information about window is contained in it's branches.  To go to a branch
of an object, you type a ".".  So if you wanted to point to the name of a
window object, you'd type:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.name
</code>	<br><br>
In this case, name is a "property" of the object "window".  There are many
branches to this window tree.  You can see a graphical representation of them
in the back of that Peachpit's Visual Start javascript book.
Look in the appendices for "Document Object Model"

Altering the contents of a page<br>
-------------------------------
<br><br>
Think of properties as adjectives and objects as nouns.  You may be asking...
what about verbs?  Verbs are called methods.  Lets say you wanted to DO something
to the window object.  I this case, we want to write something to the page.  We
type:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.document.write("my text or html here");
</code><br><br>
Write() is a "method" of the document "property" of the window "object".  Write()
is a function in the javascript API.  To be gentle, I'll just say that if you
use a method, and give it the info it needs to do it's job (parameters), it will
do stuff.  The thick javascript books have appendices full of methods and how to
use them in the back.  Once you understand the DOM, and are good at looking up
stuff in the back of the book, tack starts worrying about people replacing him ;)

Making things happen<br>
--------------------
<br><br>
Javascript code doesn't just magically run when you need it to. You have to tell
the code to do it's thing.  Fortuneately, html gives you plenty of opportunities
to boss your code around.  These opportunities are called "events".  Some events
you may be familiar with are:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onLoad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onClick<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onMouseOver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onSubmit<br><br>
	
Events need to be dealt with.  The code that does that is called an "event
handler".  Consider the following:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onLoad="alert('I triggered an event!');"
</code>	<br><br>
the event is "onLoad" and it's handler is "alert('I triggered an event!')", which
happens to be a method in this case.  Your handler can be almost anything.  It
can be a little snippet of code, a method or a function you wrote yourself.<br><br>

You can run code first thing when the page loads, before anything else happens by
just making it a statement in your script tag (not including it in a function).

Rolling your own methods<br>
------------------------
<br><br>
You may be asking, "that was cool, now how do I write my own functions?"  Always
with the questions, aren't you...well OK.  First, in your script tag, you
declare the function<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function myFunction(){<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code>	<br><br>
"function" tells the VM (in this case, a web browser) that the following is a
function.  "myFunction" tells the VM the name of the function.  The parentheses
"()" are where you put the information the function needs to do it's job.  That
info is called a "parameter"  The "curly braces" "{}" tell the VM where the
code in the function starts and ends.<br><br>

So lets say you wanted a script to run when the user clicked a button.  First
thing you'd do is tell the VM to do something when the button is clicked:<br><br>
<xmp>
    <input type="button" value="my button" onClick="myFunction()">
</xmp>	<br><br>
This tells the VM to run the function myFunction() when the button is clicked.
Make sure the function exists in your script tag, so the VM doesn't say "what"
and scratch it's head and crash:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function myFunction(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.location = "http://www.interphaze.org";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code>	<br><br>
So in this example, if the user clicked the button, the function would be
"called" and it would execute the code inside it...bringing you to the bestest
site on the net ;)<br><br>

Now that you know how to write a function, you can do a whole lot of nifty
stuff.<br><br><br><br>



Giving functions data to work with:<br><br>

Lets expand on the previous example.  lets say we want the user to enter a url,
and then click a button to go there:<br><br>
<xmp>
    <input type="text" name="myUrl">
    <input type="button" value="my button" onClick="myFunction(document.forms[0].myUrl.value)">
</xmp>	<br><br>
You'll notice I put stuff in the parentheses this time.
"document.forms[0].myUrl.value" points to the value of the form field "myUrl"
in the first form in the current document.  When the user clicks the button,
the VM calls myFunction and gives it the data from that form element.
<code><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function myFunction(theUrl){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.location = theUrl;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code><br><br>
When myFunction(theUrl) starts up, it's going to assign the value of
document.forms[0].myUrl.value to the "variable" theUrl in the parantheses.  It
can then do whatever the hell it wants to the data.  In this case, we're
changing the location of the browser window to whatever the user typed in the
myUrl form element.<br><br>

Variables are the data your code works with.  Happily, in javascript, your
variables can be any kind of data, and you don't have to worry about where or
how they live in RAM.  Use this statement to create a variable if not already
declared as a parameter of a function:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myVariable = "something";
</code><br><br>
The "var" thing tells the VM that whatever comes next is a new variable.
myVariable is the name of our new variable.  "=" is the "assignment" operator.
It tells the VM "whatever's to the right of me goes into whatever's to the
left".  "something" is the data that's gonna go into myVariable.<br><br>

There are different kinds of data you can put in a variable:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integer:   123<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float:     12.34<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String:    "one two three"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean:   true/false<br>
</code>	<br><br>
There are standard ways to name things so people understand them<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startWithLowerCaseLetters_thenCapitolizeEveryWord_easyToRead<br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gMyVariable		the g lets people know it's "global", it exists outside all the functions, and they all can use it<br><br>
					
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kMyVariable		the k means it's value should remain "constant", don't update the value of these<br>
</code>	<br><br>
There's also ways you can stuff more than one value into a variable:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myArray = new Array(5);<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[0] = "one";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[1] = "two";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[2] = "three";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[3] = "four";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[4] = "five";<br>
</code>	<br><br>
This is an "array".  It's an object that will give you different values if
you type that value's "index" in the square brackets "[]"<br><br><br><br>



Playing with your data:<br><br>

Now that you know how to fetch data from the object hierarchy and create your
own variables, it's time to screw with the data.  the things we use to do that
are called "operators".  Here's a brief summary of what they do:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a + b		add a and b together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a - b		subtract b from a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a * b		multiply a and b<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a / b		divide a by b<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a++			figure out a's value, then add 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++a			add 1 to a, then figure out what it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a--			figure out a's value, then subtract 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--a			subtract 1 from a, then figure out what it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a += b		put b on the end of a (string), increase the value of a by b (number)<br>
</code><br><br>
Lets say we want to build a URL:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var protocol = "http://";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var domain = "www.robot6.com";<br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myNewUrl = (protocol + domain);<br>
</code>	<br><br>
In this case when we add domain + protocol, our result will be
"http://www.robot6.com".  The parentheses work like math.  Whatever's inside
will happen first, then outside stuff will happen.  So we build our new URL
string, and then set the new variable "myNewUrl" equal to the result.<br><br>

Now lets do some math:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var five = 5;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var one = 1;<br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var twelve = (5 + 1) * 2;<br>
</code>	<br><br>
There are other operators, and different types of data interact differently with
them.  The thick books are better at describing them than I am.<br><br><br><br>



Comparing data and making choices:<br><br>

We can do logic stuff with our data:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myVar = 12;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(myVar == 12){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("my variable is equal to " + myVar + "!");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code><br><br>	
The "if" part tells the VM to do whatever's in the curlies "{}" only if the
statement in the parentheses is true.  The "==" operator is the "comparison"
operator.  It tells the VM "these things around me are the same".  It's alter
ego is "!=" which tells the VM "these things around me are not the same". So if
the statement (myVar <-these things are the same-> 12) is true, then the code
alert("my variable is equal to " + myVar + "!"); will be run.  You may be asking
"what if the statement is false".  If that's the case, either nothing happens, or
if you do this:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myVar = 12;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(myVar == 12){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("my variable is equal to " + myVar + "!");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}else{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("my variable is NOT equal to " + myVar + "!");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</code>	<br><br>
the code alert("my variable is NOT equal to " + myVar + "!"); will run instead.<br><br>

The statement in the if statement can deal with more than one piece of data:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myVar = 12;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myName = "superTack";<br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(myVar == 12 && myName == "superTack"){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("my variable is equal to " + myVar + "!");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</code>	<br><br>
The "&&" means that BOTH statements have to be true before we can run the code.
If EITHER of the two can be true, then use a "||" instead of a "&&".<br><br><br><br>



Doing the same thing over and over until you want it to stop:<br><br>

Don't be shocked by the following:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var myArray = new Array(5);<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[0] = "one";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[1] = "two";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[2] = "three";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[3] = "four";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myArray[4] = "five"; <br><br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(i=0;i<5;i++){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("This is iteration number " + myArray[i] + " of my for loop.");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</code><br><br>
The preceding is a "for loop".  The "for" tells the VM that you want to do stuff
over and over according to the data you put in the parentheses.  When the loop
starts, it looks at the "i=0;" part.  It does this only once, in the beginning.
Think of this step as telling the loop "we start at 0".  It then looks at the
"i<5;" part.  It says to itself "if i is less than 5, then do the stuff in the
curlies".  At this point, it executes the stuff in the curlies.  Next, it looks
at the "i++" part, and it increases the value of i by one.  This is one
"iteration" of the loop.  It's going to try again, knowing that now the value of
i is 1.  If i is still less than 5 (the i<5 part), it does the stuff in the
curlies again as well as the i++ part.  If i is greater than or equal to 5, then
we're done with the loop and we move on to whatever's after the for loop.<br><br>

You can use a different variable than i, use different values for the different
parts, and decrement values (--) as opposed to incrementing (++) if that's what
you want to do.<br><br>

There's another kind of loop:<br><br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(something here is true){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do this stuff;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</code><br><br>
This while loop will do whatever's in the curlies as long as the statement in the
parentheses is true.  Set up your parentheses stuff the same way you would an if
statement.
