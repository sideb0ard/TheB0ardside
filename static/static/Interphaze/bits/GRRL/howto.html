Installation Instructions for  setting up GRRL monitoring. 
[Beta Instructions. Read the source code for variables inuse]

Intro

GRRL, (Graphing and Remote Reporting Lackey) has several components.
It is built on top of Tonias Oetiker's rrdtool, available at http://ee-
staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/.
There are three perl scripts which provide the GRRL functionality.
The first script lives on the client computers to be monitored.
It is run once a minute and calls the system tool Vmstat, takes
the output relevant to CPU and Memory utilization,
and sends this output via UDP to our second script.
The second script is a UDP server which lives on our
monitoring station. It accepts these utilization reports and puts them into an
RRD database for each host.
The third script runs from cron every half hour, and generates an updated
Graph for each host. Four graphs for each host are created, Free Memory over
the past hour and over the past day, and CPU Utilization over the past houri
and past day.


This can all be run without root privs so you may wanna create a user for this.

1.	Setup Client software.
Create a directory  /usr/local/grrl/bin on the client host. 
Copy the grrl_clnt.pl into this directory. Edit any variables, i.e server IP address and 
port number.
  Start the script to run in the background.

2.	Setup Server Monitor.
The machine to act as the monitor needs to have the rrdtool installed,
And a webserver (at least to view the output GIF's easily)

Create a directory /usr/local/grrl/
With the subdirs:
	       bin/
	       grafs/
	       dbz/

Copy the grrl_svr.pl and  grrl_graph.pl into bin/

Create the appropriate databases for the hosts:
CD into dbz/
"rrdtool  create <hostname>.rrd –s 60 DS:swapfree:GAUGE:300:U:U \ 
DS:memfree:GAUGE:300:U:U DS:cpuusr:GAUGE:300:U:U \
DS:cpusys:GAUGE:300:U:U DS:cpuidle:GAUGE:300:U:U \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:10080 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:20:10080"

Start the Server.

3.	Setup the grrl_graph.pl cron job.
Also on the monitoring station, as the user who will run the cron job, type:
"crontab -e" which should invoke your editor.
Enter:
"0,30 * * * * /usr/local/grrl/bin/grrl_graph.pl"
This should run the graph program on the hour and on the half hour. 


4.	Setup web Page with output to be viewed.
In the HTTPD docroot directory, create a symbolic link
To the /usr/local/grrl/grafs directory.
Create an HTML document to display the grafs.
