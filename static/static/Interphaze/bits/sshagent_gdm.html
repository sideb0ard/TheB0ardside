Just a quick note, more personal really, than a paper.

So... ssh-agent is one of the coolest things ever.
ssh-agent allows you to type your passphrase once, unlocking your private ssh
key. To use it, you call 'ssh-agent [prog]' where prog is usually a shell,
and every sub-process under that shell has access to your key, allowing
you to ssh to any host you've setup previously without typing your password.
I ain't gonna go into the details of how it works, check the man 
pages for that, but basically i'v had to set this up on a few systems
and i always forgot what i had to do, so this is my notes to remember.

Step 1
------

Generate ssh public/private key pair
type:
'ssh-keygen'
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ ssh-keygen
Generating RSA keys:  ....................................ooooooO..................ooooooO
Key generation complete.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thorsten/.ssh/identity):

enter a pass phrase for your key. I shan't rant about pass phrase security.

Step 2
------
Copy your ~/.ssh/identity.pub to remote host you want to log into, and cat the 
contents into your remote file .ssh/authorized_keys.
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ scp .ssh/identity.pub thorsten@muzak.interphaze.org:id.myhomemachine
thorsten@muzak.interphaze.org's password:

[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ ssh muzak.interphaze.org
thorsten@muzak.interphaze.org's password: 
Last login: Fri Jan 26 17:52:11 2001 from winux.sideb0ard.
OpenBSD 2.7 (GENERIC) #25: Sat May 13 18:04:26 MDT 2000

Welcome to muzak.interphaze.org

non-welcome visitors must sign the guest book.

bash-2.04$ cat id.myhomemachine >> .ssh/authorized_keys 

Step 3 
------

Let's test it. Get back on our local machine.
First we fire up ssh-agent with a shell:
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ ssh-agent bash

then using 'ssh-add' we can get access to the key
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ ssh-add 
Need passphrase for /home/thorsten/.ssh/identity
Enter passphrase for thorsten@winux: 
Identity added: /home/thorsten/.ssh/identity (thorsten@winux)
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ 


Now you should be able to now:

[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ ssh muzak
Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding.
Last login: Mon Jan 29 04:02:43 2001 from winux
[thorsten@muzak thorsten]$ 

Step 4
------

Auto starting ssh-agent

sweet, so now it's working. This article was about how to set this up 
to start automatically. I did numerous web search's and most of em had different
files where it said to insert ssh-agent, but none of them worked for me,
so this is what worked for me, on a RedHat 7.0 system, running Helix
Gnome and GDM as the login manager.

I created a file in my home directory called .Xclients,
with the ocntents
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ more .Xclients 
#!/bin/bash
exec ssh-agent gnome-session
[thorsten@winux thorsten]$ 

made the file executable, and basically now, whenever i start my gnome-session,
i am always running under the ssh-agent. Now, when i login, first thing i do is i
run ssh-add once, and from then on passwordless logins, or at least to all the hosts
you've previously copied the contents of your identity.pub over to. sweee-eet!
