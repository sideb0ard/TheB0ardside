<pre>Mad props to the Glasgow label Chemikal Underground.
Being from Glasow, but now living in San Francisco, i 
still follow the label closely, and one of the main things 
i miss about Glasgow was the vibrant local music scene,
which was helped greatly by the DIY attitude of Chemikal.
The label was created by the newly formed band The Delgados 
in 1994. Full of energy and youthful optimism, they stuck a 
finger up to the London record labels that were the status

Hey, ya know what, rather than me re-writing their own bio, 
go check out their site for yourself, and get the info
straight from the horses mouth. The site is clean and nicely 
designed, with good info on the label's current roster, 
dicographies, photos and tourdates.
Unfortunately, no song samples, but hey, you got napster 
don't ya? ;)
