      <description>Well then, well then!
Big changes afoot! This has been my personal blog for many years, just random videos I dig and the occasional content of my own. The name &amp;lsquo;B0ardside&amp;rsquo; was one I originally thought of as the name of a venue I would one day own. Well! That time is now.
With Covid going on, I decided to experiment with my backyard more for open-air shows, putting on my first show in early september, which went well.</description>

      <description>I was out in London for 10 days recently, where I attended the JUCE Audio Developers Conference. Some great talks! I particularly enjoyed this one by Phil Burk on HMSL - Hierarchical Music Specification Language - a language he was involved in designing a Mill College, here in the Bay Area from the mid eighties till the early nineties. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked Phil to present a simlilar talk at Algorithmic Art Assembly 2020, which he&amp;rsquo;s agreed to!</description>

I was well aware of the microsound movement, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized the depth of the theory behind granular synthesis, with it&amp;rsquo;s history going back to the 1940s, and early practise from Xenakis (using tapes) and this lad, Curtis Roads, programming his own granular synth on a PDP-11/20 in 1974 - what a bad-ass! Check this site for some good background and papers.
I found these videos of Curtis Roads, via the site linked above.</description>

  this older one i found from 2015 is equally as entertaining, I love the opening sequence, it&amp;rsquo;s got a kind of &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; Portlandia vibe!

      <description>I just read this pretty awesome book &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo; by Jarett Kobek. It has a nice cynical irreverence, but very astute awareness of the power of modern social networks.
Coincidentally, I just came across this decent talk from Joel Spolsky, which if you kinda squint a little, sorta touches upon a few similar subjects as in &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo;, at least in that there a lot of assumptions and decisions baked into the algorithms in modern software, a lot of hidden power structures and bias.</description>

&amp;ldquo;It is one-o-clock in the morning. You&amp;rsquo;ve had a long and tiresome day, and despite your best intentions, dozed off far before you meant to.
Asleep in the embrace of your old blue La-Z-Boy, you feel a flicker like a breeze full of static at room temperature. You awaken.
The television is still on.

I&amp;rsquo;ve just started watching this podcast series and it&amp;rsquo;s excellent - this one in particular is super relevant, bringing one of the best features from Golang into C. I like the minimalism of the project, it seems very much in alignment with the philosophy behind Suckless.

      <description>My mother, over in Glasgow, was telling me about a BBC program called A Day In The Life, and specifically of an episode about Frank QUitely - i found it on youtube.com for about 30 mins but it&amp;rsquo;s already been taken down. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see it either!!).
Fortunately however, I did find this lovely interview with &amp;ldquo;Frank&amp;rdquo; (whose name i just found out is a stage name! )</description>

      <description>More and more I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling with Go, which, mainly due to Hacker News, i&amp;rsquo;ve been reading so many good things about. The syntax is super easy to pick up, but the killer feature seems to be the concurrency primitives - the Go Functions and message passing Channels seem like a super tight, rock solid implementation of Hoare&amp;rsquo;s Communicating Sequential Processes. The following video is a really succinct walk through of building a concurent multi-protocol chat application ala Chat Roulette.</description>

      <description>This talk is incredibly informative - Twitter have their own fork of OpenJDK, in which they have enabled registers on the CPU, normally used by the Java Compiler - this enables Frame Pointers which perf can read and translate, enabling a full Stack trace from JVM bytecode right down into the kernel.
Beyond simply CPU counters and stack trace, they also tie in other JVM flags which export DTrace counters, and use these to construct connections between memory allocation and the running process, so in the end you have a tool which can spans JVM -&amp;gt; kernel connections, alongside CPU -&amp;gt; memory.</description>

It tells the story of Sir Clive Sinclair and his rivalry with Acorn computers who produced the BBC Micro - the BBC Micro was the first machine I ever used, back in High School sometime in the mid 1980s, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum was the first computer i owned.</description>

      <description>Seems like there is quite a move towards more simple blogging platforms, with a number of static site generators all popping up, building upon the simplicity and growing popularity of Markdown, a stripped back text-to-HTML syntax, and touting the lack of a needed database. These site generators work usually via uploading or editing the markdown files and have a pre-processor convert the markdown to static html files, alongside some form of templating system.</description>

Highlight of the conference for me was Brendan Gregg speaking on Performance Analysis Methodologies - most of his talk was based upon a paper he just published in ACM - Thinking Methodically About Performance.
The talks haven&#39;t yet been published on the Usenix website, but Brendan&#39;s blog has a ton of great looking content and older talks including this one on Visualisations for Performance Analysis</description>

      <description>I must admit MySQL replication is something I&#39;ve never felt too comfortable with - in most of my positions, I&#39;ve had the luxury of working with a full time DBA who would handle all database related work. In my current workplace we have three major pairs of database machines, and have been going through upgrading them all to Percona MySQL 5.5. As you&#39;d expect data integrity is of the highest importance, so discovering this Percona Table Checksum tool is a real life saver, providing an amazing tool for verifying and fixing any drift or problems with MySQL slaves.</description>

At the host level I also wanted to track the incoming DNS queries using tcpdump. I could see them streaming into the new host, and visually you could see an obvious difference when viewing the output of the same command on the old host.</description>

      <description>I use tcpdump a lot, but mostly at a reasonably high level, only really restricting the capture to host and port info, then pulling the dump back into Wireshark for nicer visualisation and easier filtering.
A couple of months back I read Moonwalking With Einsten, which is a nice pop-science history of the importance of memory in previous societies, alongside the contemporary phenomena of competitive memory competitions. The book is great, and explains how feats of memory are achieved via the technique of memory palaces, a technique dating back to Roman times - spatial memory relationships.</description>

ORBs have become so integral to our life and yet they are barely a 7 year old technology. It is worth reflecting on the brief history of these astounding devices, upon which we now rely so heavily.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately I forget where I found this link - Hacker News? The Edge Newsletter? I dunno, but it&#39;s a pretty interesting one -
A debate between an MIT professor, Erik Brynjolfsson, and an Economist, Tyler Cowen, about the the role of technology in driving economic growth. My views side with the MIT professor, as does most of the audience in the debate. I won&#39;t repeat any of the arguments made in the debate, but what I will add is that the unequal distribution of wealth we see around today is not a symptom of lack of technological growth, it is purely down to good old fashioned political manipulation and deep rooted traditions of cronyism, a tradition thousands of years old.</description>

I started studying Sociology a few years back with the Open University, but never managed to complete my course as I got a job here in the States and turned my study-time back towards practical technology. I did however study it long enough for it have quite a profound effect on my understanding and conceptualisation of networking, and felt especially influenced by the works of Manuel Castells and Stephen Graham.</description>

      <description>At work, our old code deployment strategy was basically a wrapper script doing an svn checkout and some symlinking. With our move to Puppet for config management, we also moved to using Apt packaging for our code deployment, tying them together with a line similar to :
class foo-export {
package { &amp;#039;foo-export&amp;#039;: ensure = latest }
}
So that whenever we deploy a new version of a package to our apt-repo, it can then be installed with a:</description>

      <description>I finished reading James Gleick&#39;s The Information tonite - so good!
Really, the central character is Claude Shannon, who I&#39;m ashamed to admit I didn&#39;t previously know much about. Had a quick search when i finished it and found this decent little 30 min documentary which gives a good overview -</description>

      <description>I started reading James Gleick&#39;s &amp;#8220;The Information&amp;#8221; last week and haven&#39;t been able to put it down yet - so good!
I just found this video of a talk he presented at Google last year on the book, looks ace, i&#39;ll save it for watching this evening.</description>

      <title>Like Treacle, Solving Perl Net::SFTP Slow Transfer Speeds</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to track down problems with really slow network transfer speeds between my servers and several DSPs. I knew it wasn&#39;t local I/O, as we could hit around 60Mb/s to some services, whereas the problematic ones were a sluggish 0.30Mb/s; I knew we weren&#39;t hitting our bandwidth limit, as cacti showed us daily peaks of only around 500Mb/s of our 600Mb/s line. I was working with the network engineer on the other side, running tcpdump captures while uploading a file and analysing that in Wireshark&#39;s IO Graphs - stream looked absolutely fine, no lost packets, big non-changing tcp receive windows.</description>

      <description>I have a speedtest perl script i wrote - nothing complicated, takes a file and uploads it to a remote FTP or SFTP server, while calculating how long, then gives you a a measure of the MB/per second bandwidth between two sites.
I want it available on a selection of machines so it can run from wherever, so I thought i&#39;d package it up as a .DEB file and stick it in our local repo.</description>

      <description>I put together a quick perl script for comparing installed CPAN modules between two hosts. Find it here.
Quite easy to use:
Usage: ./CompareHostCpanModules.pl login@host1 login@host2
The script ssh&#39;s into both hosts (so it&#39;s easier if you have your ssh-keys setup) and grabs a list of installed CPAN modules and versions, then outputs the differences - it returns two lists - one of modules installed but having different versions, and another list of modules missing from the second host.</description>

      <description>At my work, we&#39;re now really digging into using Puppet - no longer just as a TechOps tools, but for our whole development cycle.
The hardest thing I&#39;ve come across so far is in deploying Perl CPAN packages, although i have been using manifest/recipe i found here -

So two things here - i started to watch this video with Robert Noyce talking about the development of the IC, but in the introduction and in his opening, they talk about an article written by Tom Wolfe about Noyce - now, Tom Wolfe was a massive influence on my teenage self, or at least one of his books, The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which a friends older brother passed on to me when i was fifteen.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve inherited some Production Sun Fire X4470 boxes, which upon first look appeared to only have 2 x 140GB drives. Checking the purchase orders however, revealed that they should in fact have 4 x 140GB drives, a fact confirmed by &amp;#8220;dmesg |grep scsi&amp;#8221;.
These Sun Fire servers come with an internal 6Gb SAS PCIe RAID HBA which are managed via the LSI MegaRAID Management Suite. Unfortunately, the LSI website is a nightmare to navigate and has been re-arranged with no-redirects, requires a login and in general makes it very hard to find and download the MegaCLI utility.</description>

I&#39;ve been creating a whole load of Xen hosts, most of which are cloned from an initial image I built using Xen-tools. I&#39;ve just finished a script which is over on my github page, which basically automates what was previously a manual process.
Basically, it copies your existing disk.img and swap.img, generates a new xen.</description>

Vagrant is a framework for building and deploying Virtual Machine environments, using Oracle VirtualBox for the actual VMs and utilizing Chef for configuration management. Watching through this intro video:

      <description>Interesting article on GigaOm this morning about Facebook benchmarking a 64-core chip from Tilera. The X86 processor architecture has been in a dominant for so many years, not based upon any inherent sophistication, but more based upon chance and circumstance (see this vid for more details around the 48min mark), so it does feel about time for a new advancement in hardware architecture. Be interesting to watch this space and see what develops.</description>

One of the things referenced in it was John Von Neumann&#39;s 1948 paper &amp;#8216;The General and Logical Theory Of Automata&#39; which &amp;#8220;enlarges upon Turing&#39;s idea of a Universal Machine by proposing a tape-driven, self-producing &amp;#8216;automaton whose output is other automata&#39;&amp;#8221; - A swift google search turns up a pdf of the published paper here</description>

      <description>I keep coming across mentions of node.js, but wasn&#39;t sure what it was. This morning I&#39;ve been watching some tutorials and reading up a little, and from what I understand it&#39;s basically a network server framework built on top of Google&#39;s V8 JavaScript engine, really an abstraction for socket programming. It&#39;s main advantage is speed and scalability, due to it being based on an event driven I/O model, rather than threaded, like most other languages or frameworks.</description>

      <description>I discovered Unix back in 1998. At the time i was a lowly Windows desktop support engineer when i started dabbling with Red Hat Linux v 4.2. Compared to the process of fixing Windows 3.1 systems ( i.e. reinstall drivers and reboot - if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, reinstall OS and drivers - repeat until it does work), playing with Linux was a joy of knowledge. Every part of the installation process was a problem hiding a wormhole of required knowledge.</description>
