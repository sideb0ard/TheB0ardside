      <description>I just read this pretty awesome book &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo; by Jarett Kobek. It has a nice cynical irreverence, but very astute awareness of the power of modern social networks.
Coincidentally, I just came across this decent talk from Joel Spolsky, which if you kinda squint a little, sorta touches upon a few similar subjects as in &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo;, at least in that there a lot of assumptions and decisions baked into the algorithms in modern software, a lot of hidden power structures and bias.</description>

      <description>Seems like there is quite a move towards more simple blogging platforms, with a number of static site generators all popping up, building upon the simplicity and growing popularity of Markdown, a stripped back text-to-HTML syntax, and touting the lack of a needed database. These site generators work usually via uploading or editing the markdown files and have a pre-processor convert the markdown to static html files, alongside some form of templating system.</description>
