      <description>This talk is incredibly informative - Twitter have their own fork of OpenJDK, in which they have enabled registers on the CPU, normally used by the Java Compiler - this enables Frame Pointers which perf can read and translate, enabling a full Stack trace from JVM bytecode right down into the kernel.
Beyond simply CPU counters and stack trace, they also tie in other JVM flags which export DTrace counters, and use these to construct connections between memory allocation and the running process, so in the end you have a tool which can spans JVM -&amp;gt; kernel connections, alongside CPU -&amp;gt; memory.</description>

      <description>Found this Facebook engineering video quite fascinating, a nicely detailed platform overview of FB&#39;s new real-time analytics system: Watch live streaming video from facebookeducation at livestream.comIn the comment section, someone posted a link to a somewhat similar presentation from Twitter about their real-time solution::
