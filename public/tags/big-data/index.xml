      <description>the legendary Mike Hoover turned me on to Backblaze a few months back - they&#39;re a cloud storage provider, who opened up the design for their chassis and storage pod solution so you can build your own &amp;#8220;Storage Pod 2.0: a 135-terabyte, 4U server for $7,384&amp;#8243; (blog post here)</description>

      <title>Like Treacle, Solving Perl Net::SFTP Slow Transfer Speeds</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to track down problems with really slow network transfer speeds between my servers and several DSPs. I knew it wasn&#39;t local I/O, as we could hit around 60Mb/s to some services, whereas the problematic ones were a sluggish 0.30Mb/s; I knew we weren&#39;t hitting our bandwidth limit, as cacti showed us daily peaks of only around 500Mb/s of our 600Mb/s line. I was working with the network engineer on the other side, running tcpdump captures while uploading a file and analysing that in Wireshark&#39;s IO Graphs - stream looked absolutely fine, no lost packets, big non-changing tcp receive windows.</description>

      <description>Found this Facebook engineering video quite fascinating, a nicely detailed platform overview of FB&#39;s new real-time analytics system: Watch live streaming video from facebookeducation at livestream.comIn the comment section, someone posted a link to a somewhat similar presentation from Twitter about their real-time solution::
