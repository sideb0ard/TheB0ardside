      <description>I was out in London for 10 days recently, where I attended the JUCE Audio Developers Conference. Some great talks! I particularly enjoyed this one by Phil Burk on HMSL - Hierarchical Music Specification Language - a language he was involved in designing a Mill College, here in the Bay Area from the mid eighties till the early nineties. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked Phil to present a simlilar talk at Algorithmic Art Assembly 2020, which he&amp;rsquo;s agreed to!</description>

      <description>Alex McLean&amp;rsquo;s TidalCycles has been a big influence on my own Soundb0ard, and lately, now that my instruments are mostly built, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for ways to algorithmically modify them more.
This series of howto&amp;rsquo;s by Mike Hodnick/Kindohm have been an amazing source of inspiration - super clear and very entertaining - here&amp;rsquo;s the first episode:

I&amp;rsquo;ve generated some melodies based on their Melody RNN - although i need to spend more time with it, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been more focussed on own generative algorithms.

This is a pretty informative (promo) video from Robert Henke/Monolake showcasing his &amp;lsquo;Granulator&amp;rsquo; plugin for Ableton Live.
If i can get mine to sound anything like that i&amp;rsquo;ll be stoked!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just read &amp;lsquo;Microsound&amp;rsquo; by Curtis Roads. I was well aware of the microsound movement, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized the depth of the theory behind granular synthesis, with it&amp;rsquo;s history going back to the 1940s, and early practise from Xenakis (using tapes) and this lad, Curtis Roads, programming his own granular synth on a PDP-11/20 in 1974 - what a bad-ass! Check this site for some good background and papers.
I found these videos of Curtis Roads, via the site linked above.</description>

      <description>I just read this pretty awesome book &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo; by Jarett Kobek. It has a nice cynical irreverence, but very astute awareness of the power of modern social networks.
Coincidentally, I just came across this decent talk from Joel Spolsky, which if you kinda squint a little, sorta touches upon a few similar subjects as in &amp;lsquo;I Hate The Internet&amp;rsquo;, at least in that there a lot of assumptions and decisions baked into the algorithms in modern software, a lot of hidden power structures and bias.</description>

      <description>This is a crazy awesome animation by Anthony Lombardo and John Chrostek &amp;ndash;
&amp;ldquo;It is one-o-clock in the morning. You&amp;rsquo;ve had a long and tiresome day, and despite your best intentions, dozed off far before you meant to.
Asleep in the embrace of your old blue La-Z-Boy, you feel a flicker like a breeze full of static at room temperature. You awaken.
The television is still on.
Your eyes adjust.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m moving into a new job position soon involving way more code, working in C/C++. I&amp;rsquo;ve just started watching this podcast series and it&amp;rsquo;s excellent - this one in particular is super relevant, bringing one of the best features from Golang into C. I like the minimalism of the project, it seems very much in alignment with the philosophy behind Suckless. (There&amp;rsquo;s a previous episode, speaking with Anselm R Garbe from suckless, i&amp;rsquo;d also highly recommend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading Tony Hoare&amp;rsquo;s Communicating Sequential Processes - it&amp;rsquo;s awesome! I searched to see if I could find some youtube videos of him - this one is brilliant, him talking about what should be taught in Computer Science, the universal ideas of logic and geometry unpinning computation, going back to Euclid and Artistotle. Great stuff!

      <description>One theme I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently is a move to User Space networking - not for normal application use per se, but for specific high throughput cases, where the kernel&amp;rsquo;s general network stack&amp;rsquo;s overhead is too much. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a new thing, but something I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten around to exploring. This vid, from last year, provides an overview of three different implementations..

      <description>More and more I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling with Go, which, mainly due to Hacker News, i&amp;rsquo;ve been reading so many good things about. The syntax is super easy to pick up, but the killer feature seems to be the concurrency primitives - the Go Functions and message passing Channels seem like a super tight, rock solid implementation of Hoare&amp;rsquo;s Communicating Sequential Processes. The following video is a really succinct walk through of building a concurent multi-protocol chat application ala Chat Roulette.</description>

      <guid>http://theb0ardside.com/troubleshootingjvmtwitter/</guid>
      <description>This talk is incredibly informative - Twitter have their own fork of OpenJDK, in which they have enabled registers on the CPU, normally used by the Java Compiler - this enables Frame Pointers which perf can read and translate, enabling a full Stack trace from JVM bytecode right down into the kernel.
Beyond simply CPU counters and stack trace, they also tie in other JVM flags which export DTrace counters, and use these to construct connections between memory allocation and the running process, so in the end you have a tool which can spans JVM -&amp;gt; kernel connections, alongside CPU -&amp;gt; memory.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve been following my past few posts, you&#39;ve seen i was investigating how best to integrate the plethora of Chef testing tools that&#39;ve been coming out &amp;#8212; foodcritic, chefspec, test-kitchen, mini-test &amp;#8212; and although not testing tools per se, Berkshelf and Vagrant are the other pieces of the puzzle&amp;#8230; but how to fit them all together? What is the directory structure for keeping your Berkfile - at the top of the repo?</description>

      <description>Just got back from the Usenix/Lisa 12 conference in San Diego, and had a great time, super inspiring talks and content.
Highlight of the conference for me was Brendan Gregg speaking on Performance Analysis Methodologies - most of his talk was based upon a paper he just published in ACM - Thinking Methodically About Performance.
The talks haven&#39;t yet been published on the Usenix website, but Brendan&#39;s blog has a ton of great looking content and older talks including this one on Visualisations for Performance Analysis</description>

      <description>I must admit MySQL replication is something I&#39;ve never felt too comfortable with - in most of my positions, I&#39;ve had the luxury of working with a full time DBA who would handle all database related work. In my current workplace we have three major pairs of database machines, and have been going through upgrading them all to Percona MySQL 5.5. As you&#39;d expect data integrity is of the highest importance, so discovering this Percona Table Checksum tool is a real life saver, providing an amazing tool for verifying and fixing any drift or problems with MySQL slaves.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately I forget where I found this link - Hacker News? The Edge Newsletter? I dunno, but it&#39;s a pretty interesting one -
A debate between an MIT professor, Erik Brynjolfsson, and an Economist, Tyler Cowen, about the the role of technology in driving economic growth. My views side with the MIT professor, as does most of the audience in the debate. I won&#39;t repeat any of the arguments made in the debate, but what I will add is that the unequal distribution of wealth we see around today is not a symptom of lack of technological growth, it is purely down to good old fashioned political manipulation and deep rooted traditions of cronyism, a tradition thousands of years old.</description>

      <description>I finished reading James Gleick&#39;s The Information tonite - so good!
Really, the central character is Claude Shannon, who I&#39;m ashamed to admit I didn&#39;t previously know much about. Had a quick search when i finished it and found this decent little 30 min documentary which gives a good overview -</description>

      <description>yow, sorry, that title&#39;s a really bad pun! 
So two things here - i started to watch this video with Robert Noyce talking about the development of the IC, but in the introduction and in his opening, they talk about an article written by Tom Wolfe about Noyce - now, Tom Wolfe was a massive influence on my teenage self, or at least one of his books, The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which a friends older brother passed on to me when i was fifteen.</description>
