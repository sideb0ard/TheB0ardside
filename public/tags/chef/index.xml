      <description>If you&#39;ve been following my past few posts, you&#39;ve seen i was investigating how best to integrate the plethora of Chef testing tools that&#39;ve been coming out &amp;#8212; foodcritic, chefspec, test-kitchen, mini-test &amp;#8212; and although not testing tools per se, Berkshelf and Vagrant are the other pieces of the puzzle&amp;#8230; but how to fit them all together? What is the directory structure for keeping your Berkfile - at the top of the repo?</description>

      <description>I&#39;m looking to start using Test-Kitchen and Berkshelf, and basically trying to get my head round setting up a proper test driven Chef setup.
I found this video from last year to be quite a good introduction to some of the setup -</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reading through ThoughtWorks&#39; latest &amp;#8216;technology radar&amp;#8216; which led me to look up Vagrant, one of the tools they list as worth exploring.
Vagrant is a framework for building and deploying Virtual Machine environments, using Oracle VirtualBox for the actual VMs and utilizing Chef for configuration management. Watching through this intro video:

i was quite intrigued as it is very similar to what i was looking to achieve earlier when i was experimenting with installing Xen and configuring with Puppet.</description>
