      <description>I thought I had seen this, but no, it&amp;rsquo;s just a similar theme to other talks by Rob Pike I&amp;rsquo;ve seen - this one is quite fun to code along too, its a super neat and compact concurrency app..

      <description>More and more I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling with Go, which, mainly due to Hacker News, i&amp;rsquo;ve been reading so many good things about. The syntax is super easy to pick up, but the killer feature seems to be the concurrency primitives - the Go Functions and message passing Channels seem like a super tight, rock solid implementation of Hoare&amp;rsquo;s Communicating Sequential Processes. The following video is a really succinct walk through of building a concurent multi-protocol chat application ala Chat Roulette.</description>
