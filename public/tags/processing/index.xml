      <description>Wow. just wow&amp;hellip;
This was following me and Tack&amp;rsquo;s Codetraxx project - which is working - we&amp;rsquo;re making music and synchronized via RabbitMQ as we set out to do - however we&amp;rsquo;ve hit a bit of a wall with the algorithmic math behind musical composition, so we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus on some mathematical hack nights for a while. Another friend of mine, Matt Spendlove, had told me about The Nature Of Code which i&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to read, so I suggested we play with Processing - seems awesome already!</description>
