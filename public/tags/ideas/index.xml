      <description>Unfortunately I forget where I found this link - Hacker News? The Edge Newsletter? I dunno, but it&#39;s a pretty interesting one -
A debate between an MIT professor, Erik Brynjolfsson, and an Economist, Tyler Cowen, about the the role of technology in driving economic growth. My views side with the MIT professor, as does most of the audience in the debate. I won&#39;t repeat any of the arguments made in the debate, but what I will add is that the unequal distribution of wealth we see around today is not a symptom of lack of technological growth, it is purely down to good old fashioned political manipulation and deep rooted traditions of cronyism, a tradition thousands of years old.</description>

      <description>The Edge just published their annual Q/A in which they pose a question and ask a group of artists, scientists, and various kinds of intellectuals for their answer. This year the question was &amp;#8220;What Is Your Favorite Deep, Elegant, Or Beautiful Explanation?&amp;#8220;
