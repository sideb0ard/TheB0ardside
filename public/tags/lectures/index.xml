      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never made it very far through my copy of Abelson, Sussman and Sussman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Structure and Interpretation Of Computer Programs&amp;rsquo;, so I was super excited to find this whole series of lectures online with Harold and Gerald Jay presenting the text as a course. The lectures help a lot, making it a whole lot easier than just wading through the text yourself. I went deep over the weekend, watching the first four of them - My Lisp foo is getting strong!</description>
