      <description>wow, been finding so many good online video talks. I&#39;ve been genning up on node.js, which has led me into studying more javascript, and this latest lecture, is a massive five part series of talks about javascript. It&#39;s the first one which really stands out, and which fits in with the theme of historical lectures i&#39;ve been posting, covering the history of computing from the Jacquard Loom through the evolution of processors and programming languages up to Javascript.</description>
