      <description>I updated the IP address for both my Name Servers tonite, and was monitoring to see how quickly the new addresses were propagating. First stop was the exceptionally useful Whats My DNS
At the host level I also wanted to track the incoming DNS queries using tcpdump. I could see them streaming into the new host, and visually you could see an obvious difference when viewing the output of the same command on the old host.</description>

      <title>Like Treacle, Solving Perl Net::SFTP Slow Transfer Speeds</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to track down problems with really slow network transfer speeds between my servers and several DSPs. I knew it wasn&#39;t local I/O, as we could hit around 60Mb/s to some services, whereas the problematic ones were a sluggish 0.30Mb/s; I knew we weren&#39;t hitting our bandwidth limit, as cacti showed us daily peaks of only around 500Mb/s of our 600Mb/s line. I was working with the network engineer on the other side, running tcpdump captures while uploading a file and analysing that in Wireshark&#39;s IO Graphs - stream looked absolutely fine, no lost packets, big non-changing tcp receive windows.</description>

      <title>building a DEB package from a perl script</title>
      <link>http://theb0ardside.com/buildingadebpackagefromaperlscript/</link>

      <description>I have a speedtest perl script i wrote - nothing complicated, takes a file and uploads it to a remote FTP or SFTP server, while calculating how long, then gives you a a measure of the MB/per second bandwidth between two sites.
I want it available on a selection of machines so it can run from wherever, so I thought i&#39;d package it up as a .DEB file and stick it in our local repo.</description>

      <title>CPAN Diff script</title>

      <guid>http://theb0ardside.com/cpandiffscript/</guid>
      <description>I put together a quick perl script for comparing installed CPAN modules between two hosts. Find it here.
Quite easy to use:
Usage: ./CompareHostCpanModules.pl login@host1 login@host2
The script ssh&#39;s into both hosts (so it&#39;s easier if you have your ssh-keys setup) and grabs a list of installed CPAN modules and versions, then outputs the differences - it returns two lists - one of modules installed but having different versions, and another list of modules missing from the second host.</description>

      <description>I discovered Unix back in 1998. At the time i was a lowly Windows desktop support engineer when i started dabbling with Red Hat Linux v 4.2. Compared to the process of fixing Windows 3.1 systems ( i.e. reinstall drivers and reboot - if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, reinstall OS and drivers - repeat until it does work), playing with Linux was a joy of knowledge. Every part of the installation process was a problem hiding a wormhole of required knowledge.</description>
