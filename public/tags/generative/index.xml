      <description>This is a good chat with Doug Eck, of the Google Magenta project It&amp;rsquo;s a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on, as it has a ton of potential. I&amp;rsquo;ve generated some melodies based on their Melody RNN - although i need to spend more time with it, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been more focussed on own generative algorithms.

      <title>Curtis Roads, Microsound</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just read &amp;lsquo;Microsound&amp;rsquo; by Curtis Roads. I was well aware of the microsound movement, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized the depth of the theory behind granular synthesis, with it&amp;rsquo;s history going back to the 1940s, and early practise from Xenakis (using tapes) and this lad, Curtis Roads, programming his own granular synth on a PDP-11/20 in 1974 - what a bad-ass! Check this site for some good background and papers.
I found these videos of Curtis Roads, via the site linked above.</description>
