      <description>Just got back from the Usenix/Lisa 12 conference in San Diego, and had a great time, super inspiring talks and content.
Highlight of the conference for me was Brendan Gregg speaking on Performance Analysis Methodologies - most of his talk was based upon a paper he just published in ACM - Thinking Methodically About Performance.
The talks haven&#39;t yet been published on the Usenix website, but Brendan&#39;s blog has a ton of great looking content and older talks including this one on Visualisations for Performance Analysis</description>

      <description>Ever since reading Neal Stephenson&#39;s Mother Earth Mother Board article, I&#39;ve been quite fascinated with the undersea cables which physically connect the land masses of the world. This map, linked above is an amazing view into this part of the Internet&#39;s current infrastructure.
