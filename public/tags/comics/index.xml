      <description>My mother, over in Glasgow, was telling me about a BBC program called A Day In The Life, and specifically of an episode about Frank QUitely - i found it on youtube.com for about 30 mins but it&amp;rsquo;s already been taken down. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see it either!!).
Fortunately however, I did find this lovely interview with &amp;ldquo;Frank&amp;rdquo; (whose name i just found out is a stage name! )</description>
