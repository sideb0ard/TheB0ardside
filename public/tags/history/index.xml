      <description>I bookmarked this to watch after Hilary Mason tweeted it recently - i thought i had previously watched it but after seeing it tonite I realised i hadn&amp;rsquo;t - super fun history, really taking me back to my youth! It tells the story of Sir Clive Sinclair and his rivalry with Acorn computers who produced the BBC Micro - the BBC Micro was the first machine I ever used, back in High School sometime in the mid 1980s, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum was the first computer i owned.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve started reading George Dyson&#39;s &amp;#8220;Turing&#39;s Cathedral&amp;#8221;, and really enjoying it - I love reading the historical context of technological progress, feels like a lot of sociological reading, filling in another of the endless jigsaw pieces of a larger all-encompassing narrative.

      <description>Unfortunately I forget where I found this link - Hacker News? The Edge Newsletter? I dunno, but it&#39;s a pretty interesting one -
A debate between an MIT professor, Erik Brynjolfsson, and an Economist, Tyler Cowen, about the the role of technology in driving economic growth. My views side with the MIT professor, as does most of the audience in the debate. I won&#39;t repeat any of the arguments made in the debate, but what I will add is that the unequal distribution of wealth we see around today is not a symptom of lack of technological growth, it is purely down to good old fashioned political manipulation and deep rooted traditions of cronyism, a tradition thousands of years old.</description>

      <description>[[ image half-inched from here]]
I started studying Sociology a few years back with the Open University, but never managed to complete my course as I got a job here in the States and turned my study-time back towards practical technology. I did however study it long enough for it have quite a profound effect on my understanding and conceptualisation of networking, and felt especially influenced by the works of Manuel Castells and Stephen Graham.</description>

      <description>yow, sorry, that title&#39;s a really bad pun! 
So two things here - i started to watch this video with Robert Noyce talking about the development of the IC, but in the introduction and in his opening, they talk about an article written by Tom Wolfe about Noyce - now, Tom Wolfe was a massive influence on my teenage self, or at least one of his books, The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which a friends older brother passed on to me when i was fifteen.</description>

      <description>Interesting article on GigaOm this morning about Facebook benchmarking a 64-core chip from Tilera. The X86 processor architecture has been in a dominant for so many years, not based upon any inherent sophistication, but more based upon chance and circumstance (see this vid for more details around the 48min mark), so it does feel about time for a new advancement in hardware architecture. Be interesting to watch this space and see what develops.</description>

      <description>wow, been finding so many good online video talks. I&#39;ve been genning up on node.js, which has led me into studying more javascript, and this latest lecture, is a massive five part series of talks about javascript. It&#39;s the first one which really stands out, and which fits in with the theme of historical lectures i&#39;ve been posting, covering the history of computing from the Jacquard Loom through the evolution of processors and programming languages up to Javascript.</description>

I&#39;m only 47 pages in so far, but it&#39;s already amazing. One of the things referenced in it was John Von Neumann&#39;s 1948 paper &amp;#8216;The General and Logical Theory Of Automata&#39; which &amp;#8220;enlarges upon Turing&#39;s idea of a Universal Machine by proposing a tape-driven, self-producing &amp;#8216;automaton whose output is other automata&#39;&amp;#8221; - A swift google search turns up a pdf of the published paper here</description>

      <description>I discovered Unix back in 1998. At the time i was a lowly Windows desktop support engineer when i started dabbling with Red Hat Linux v 4.2. Compared to the process of fixing Windows 3.1 systems ( i.e. reinstall drivers and reboot - if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, reinstall OS and drivers - repeat until it does work), playing with Linux was a joy of knowledge. Every part of the installation process was a problem hiding a wormhole of required knowledge.</description>
