      <description>This is a good chat with Doug Eck, of the Google Magenta project It&amp;rsquo;s a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on, as it has a ton of potential. I&amp;rsquo;ve generated some melodies based on their Melody RNN - although i need to spend more time with it, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been more focussed on own generative algorithms.

      <description>Up at XOXO last year, the Jenn Schiffer talk was definitely one of the most fun:
  this older one i found from 2015 is equally as entertaining, I love the opening sequence, it&amp;rsquo;s got a kind of &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; Portlandia vibe!

      <description>My mother, over in Glasgow, was telling me about a BBC program called A Day In The Life, and specifically of an episode about Frank QUitely - i found it on youtube.com for about 30 mins but it&amp;rsquo;s already been taken down. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see it either!!).
Fortunately however, I did find this lovely interview with &amp;ldquo;Frank&amp;rdquo; (whose name i just found out is a stage name! )</description>

      <description>Wow. just wow&amp;hellip;
   [Tack](https://twitter.com/tackyy) turned me onto this guy the other day - i love him! Artist/Skater/Hacker - whats not to love?! This was following me and Tack&amp;rsquo;s Codetraxx project - which is working - we&amp;rsquo;re making music and synchronized via RabbitMQ as we set out to do - however we&amp;rsquo;ve hit a bit of a wall with the algorithmic math behind musical composition, so we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus on some mathematical hack nights for a while.</description>
