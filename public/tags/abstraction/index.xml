      <description>Unfortunately I forget where I found this link - Hacker News? The Edge Newsletter? I dunno, but it&#39;s a pretty interesting one -
A debate between an MIT professor, Erik Brynjolfsson, and an Economist, Tyler Cowen, about the the role of technology in driving economic growth. My views side with the MIT professor, as does most of the audience in the debate. I won&#39;t repeat any of the arguments made in the debate, but what I will add is that the unequal distribution of wealth we see around today is not a symptom of lack of technological growth, it is purely down to good old fashioned political manipulation and deep rooted traditions of cronyism, a tradition thousands of years old.</description>

      <description>This is an excellent talk about the interaction between the various layers of memory abstraction from the a machine&#39;s physical memory down through the Hypervisor&#39;s view, to the Guest OS&#39;s and down into the JVM:

      <description>I finished reading James Gleick&#39;s The Information tonite - so good!
Really, the central character is Claude Shannon, who I&#39;m ashamed to admit I didn&#39;t previously know much about. Had a quick search when i finished it and found this decent little 30 min documentary which gives a good overview -</description>

      <title>Vagrant and Chef setup</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reading through ThoughtWorks&#39; latest &amp;#8216;technology radar&amp;#8216; which led me to look up Vagrant, one of the tools they list as worth exploring.
Vagrant is a framework for building and deploying Virtual Machine environments, using Oracle VirtualBox for the actual VMs and utilizing Chef for configuration management. Watching through this intro video:

i was quite intrigued as it is very similar to what i was looking to achieve earlier when i was experimenting with installing Xen and configuring with Puppet.</description>

      <description>I keep coming across mentions of node.js, but wasn&#39;t sure what it was. This morning I&#39;ve been watching some tutorials and reading up a little, and from what I understand it&#39;s basically a network server framework built on top of Google&#39;s V8 JavaScript engine, really an abstraction for socket programming. It&#39;s main advantage is speed and scalability, due to it being based on an event driven I/O model, rather than threaded, like most other languages or frameworks.</description>

      <description>First draft of my Record Store Bot is live over on Github - basically tying a Chatbot::Eliza style interface to Last.fm web services for an interactive (hopefully amusing) music recommendation bot.
Works surprisingly well - although only has one method at the moment..</description>
